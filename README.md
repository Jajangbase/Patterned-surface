# Patterned-surface

1. Folder
   Described files can be found in each folder.
   
   Figures: All high-resolution figures used in the paper
   
   Results: Local traction, processed results such as contact area, real mean pressure, etc.  (all pressure values and contact area are normalized by the contact modulus and nominal area)
   
   Surfaces: Surface topography

2. Subfolder
   The following subfolders can be found in the Results and Surfaces folders
   
   Drum surface: surfaces generated by the amplified instability method
   
   Spinodoid surface: surfaces generated by the spinodal decomposition method

3. Surfaces (e.g. Spin_0_surfHeights1.txt; Drum_1.48_surfHeights4.txt)
   
   'Drum' and 'Spin' mean its manufacturing method, the amplified instability method, or the spinodal decomposition method
   
   0, 1.48 mean the manufacturing parameter, a function of centrifugal acceleration, or directionality
   
   surfHeights means that this data represents surface topography
   
   1,4 mean case numbering
   
4. Results
   Results data has two different types of data
   
   1) Processes data like contact area, rms of local pressures (e.g. Drum_1.48_Pconc.txt, Spin_90_conArea.txt)
      
      'Drum' and 'Spin' mean its manufacturing method, the amplified instability method, or the spinodal decomposition method
      
      90, 1.48 mean the manufacturing parameter, a function of centrifugal acceleration, or directionality
      
      Pconc: stress concentration (maxP/meanP) # Note that this is not the stress concentration we used in our paper
      
      Prms: std of local pressure
      
      PrmsT: rms of local pressure
      
      Prms0: std of non-zero local pressure
      
      conArea: contact area
      
      maxP: maximum local pressure
      
      maxU: maximum local displacement
      
      meanP: mean of local pressure
      
      pL: nominal mean pressure

   2) Local pressure (e.g. Spin_0_surfTraction_trial_0p0_0.001.txt, Drum_4.92_surfTraction_trial_9p0_1.0.txt)
      
      'Drum' and 'Spin' mean its manufacturing method, the amplified instability method, or the spinodal decomposition method
      
      0, 1.48 mean the manufacturing parameter, a function of centrifugal acceleration, or directionality
      
      surfTraction means that this data represents local pressure
      
      trial_0, trial_9 mean these are the results of case 0 and case 9, respectively
      
      p0_0.001, p0_1.0 mean nominal mean pressure
